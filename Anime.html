<h2><u>Types Of Anime</u>:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dnen_manga">Shonen</a></em> can be translated to mean few years in English, and refers to a younger male audience. Shonen anime usually look to meet all the interests of younger males. Most of the series feature a young male protagonist. Shonen anime have some of the most popular and well known franchise as they contain a little bit of everything. There's elements of action, adventure, fighting, drama, comedy, and coming of age.
     </li>
    <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinen_manga">Seinen</a></em> can be translated as young man in English, and targets the young adult or adult male viewers. Seinen anime usually have the same stories and themes as shonen, however are more sophisticated than shonen.They are more <br>
        violent, sexual, satirical, or psychologically intense and therefore cater to a more mature audience. </li>
    <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_manga">Shoujo</a></em> is the opposite of shonen, translated in English as young girl. Shoujo focuses more on the interpersonal relationship and romance in the story rather than the fighting and action. The series tend to be more dramatic, but also<br>
         still include the adventure, comedy and action that are prevalent in shonen</li>
    <li>As shoujo is the counterpart of shonen, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josei_manga">josei</a></em> is the opposite of seinen. Seinen shows are targeted towards adult female viewers and focus more on romance than anything. They usually have a more realistic feel than shoujo and<br>
         feature adult woman. </li>
    <li>Last but not least we have another genre that most have at least seen one show from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_anime_and_manga">kodomomuke</a></em>. Kodomomuke means directed at children in English, and is the only genre suitable for young viewers. They usually are super cute,<br>
         imaginative, and creative, as well as has a moral message. </li>
</ul>
